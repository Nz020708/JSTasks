1. User gives 2 numbers (A and B). Print to the console the result of dividing A by B and the remainder of the division.
2. The user enters 2 values (A and B). Swap the contents of variables A and B (that means the value of variable B must be assigned to variable A, and vice versa).
3. The user enters 3 non-zero numbers (A, B and C). Print to the console the solution (the value of X) of the standard linear equation, where A*X+B=C.
4. User gives 2 numbers (A and B). If A>B then print to the console the result of A+B, if A=B then the result of A*B, if A<B then A-B.
5. User gives 3 numbers (a, b, c). Find out and print to the console the solution of quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0.
6. The user enters a two-digit number. Print the literal representation of this number to the console. For example, typing "25" will display "twenty five" in the console, and "13" will display "thirteen".
7. User gives 3 numbers (x, y, r). Find out if point with location (x,y) is inside a circle with radius r? (the center of the circle is at the origin)
